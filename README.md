An OPD visit (Outpatient Department) is plannedâ€”like for check-ups, non-emergent tests, minor complaints. You walk in or book appointment, see doctor, do tests, then leave the same day.

Emergency admission is for serious/unplanned conditionsâ€”heart attack, fracture, acute infection, breathing difficulty. You get triaged, examined immediately, may be admitted to ER/ICU, and kept under observation.

Multispeciality hospitals like Care and Cure have both OPD and Emergency services robustly. OPD is calm, scheduled, covers many specialties. Emergency is fast, equipped for critical stabilisation and ICU transfer if necessary.
